  intro: Hello!  I am Benedict based in Wimbledon, London.  I am a senior consultant for a large, international IT consultancy working as a software engineer, a profession I have been doing since late 2012.
  details:
    - Although my work involves a wide variety of technologies, I specialise in the Microsoft .NET platform, including ASP.NET, and Microsoft Azure.
    - My IT career actually followed my life hobby as my academic background is in chemistry!  I hold a masters degree and PhD in inorganic and theoretical chemistry from the University of Sheffield.
    - Away from work I am involved in music and amateur operatics and, to a limited extent, some sport including fitness and Taekwondo.

  details:
    - I have always been interested in computers since the age of 6 when my family bought our first computer with Windows 3.1.  I discovered programming when I was 11 with BBC BASIC and Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 when I was 12, still one of the greatest Christmas presents ever!
    - I specialise in the Microsoft .NET platform, including ASP.NET for the web, and Microsoft Azure cloud but happily work with many difference technologies.  On a daily basis I use and develop on Windows, macOS and Linux and have had experience with development for mobile platforms such as iOS and Android.
    - My other IT interests include game development and some dabbling in low-level programming with x86 and ARM assembly!  And talking of games I do enjoy some unwinding time on the Xbox One!
