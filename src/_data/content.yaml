  intro: Hello!  I am Benedict based in Wimbledon, London.  I am a senior consultant for a large, international IT consultancy working as a software engineer, a profession I have been doing since late 2012.
  details:
    - Although my work involves a wide variety of technologies, I specialise in the Microsoft .NET platform, including ASP.NET, and Microsoft Azure.
    - My IT career actually followed my life hobby as my academic background is in chemistry!  I hold a masters degree and PhD in inorganic and theoretical chemistry from the University of Sheffield.
    - Away from work I am involved in music and amateur operatics and, to a limited extent, some sport including fitness and Taekwondo.
